## Implementation Status

### Completely Implemented

1. **Service Layer**:
   - The entire service layer has been implemented following a clean architecture pattern
   - API services with proper error handling and interceptors
   - WebSocket services with connection management, broadcasting, and event handling
   - Encryption services with key management and rotation

2. **Context Providers**:
   - All context providers have been implemented to provide application-wide state management
   - Authentication context for user management
   - WebSocket context for real-time communication
   - Encryption context for message security

3. **Core UI Components**:
   - Message input and list components for communication
   - User list and status components for presence management
   - All components integrated with the new service layer

4. **Utilities**:
   - Error handling system for consistent error management
   - Caching system for performance optimization
   - Validation utilities for input verification and PHI detection

### Pending Implementation

1. **Application Shell**:
   - Main application container needs to be updated to use the new contexts
   - Header component needs integration with authentication context
   - Notification system needs to be implemented

2. **Admin Components**:
   - All admin components need to be updated to use the new service layer
   - Channel, user, and role management components need service integration

3. **Authentication UI**:
   - Login form needs to be updated to use the new authentication context

4. **Entry Point**:
   - Main entry point needs to be updated to initialize the new service architecture

### Migration Strategy

For the remaining components, the migration strategy is:

1. **Preserve UI Appearance**:
   - Keep the same visual design and user experience
   - Maintain component API for seamless integration

2. **Replace Service Calls**:
   - Replace direct service calls with context-based calls
   - Use the new error handling system consistently

3. **Add New Features**:
   - Add connection status indicators to appropriate components
   - Implement real-time updates for all components
   - Add encryption status indicators where relevant

4. **Enhance Error Handling**:
   - Implement consistent error handling across all components
   - Add user-friendly error messages
   - Ensure proper error logging for HIPAA compliance

## Next Implementation Focus

The immediate focus for the next phase of implementation should be:

1. **AppContainer Component**:
   - This is the core component that initializes all contexts
   - Critical for proper application bootstrapping

2. **NotificationSystem Component**:
   - Important for user experience and alerts
   - Needs to integrate with WebSocket for real-time notifications

3. **LoginForm Component**:
   - Essential for user authentication
   - Needs to work with the new authentication context

After these critical components are implemented, the focus can shift to the admin components and final integration testing.
