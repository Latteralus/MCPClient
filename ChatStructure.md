## Implementation Status

### Completed Components

1. **Service Layer**:
   - All API services with proper error handling and interceptors
   - WebSocket services with connection management, broadcasting, and event handling
   - Encryption services with key management and rotation

2. **Context Providers**:
   - Authentication context for user management
   - WebSocket context for real-time communication
   - Encryption context for message security

3. **Core UI Components**:
   - Message input and list components for communication
   - User list and status components for presence management

4. **Common Components**:
   - ModalBase for standardized modal dialogs

5. **Admin Components**:
   - AdminPanel for the main administration interface
   - UserManager for user management
   - UserTable for displaying user data
   - UserToolbar for user management actions
   - CreateUserModal for adding new users

6. **Notification System**:
   - Complete notification system for real-time alerts
   - Desktop notifications support
   - Sound notifications
   - Visual notification indicators

7. **Utilities**:
   - Error handling system for consistent error management
   - Caching system for performance optimization
   - Validation utilities for input verification and PHI detection
   - Logging system for HIPAA-compliant audit tracking

### Pending Implementation

1. **Admin Components**:
   - ChannelManager for channel administration
   - Channel-specific components like ChannelTable and related modals
   - Remaining user-related modals (EditUserModal, DeleteUserModal, etc.)
   - Role management components

### Next Implementation Focus

The immediate focus for the next phase of implementation should be:

1. **Remaining User Management Modals**:
   - EditUserModal for updating existing users
   - DeleteUserModal for removing users
   - ResetPasswordModal for password management
   - ImportUsersModal for batch user creation

2. **Channel Management Components**:
   - ChannelManager component
   - ChannelTable for displaying channels
   - Channel-related modals for creation and management

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Comprehensive testing of all implemented components
   - Verifying proper communication between components
   - Testing error handling and edge cases
